# Exploration of Seattle's Building Permits through the Open Data Program

This project's objective is to inform readers about the activity of permit issuance across different areas of Seattle and analyze the changes between pre-COVID and post-COVID years. While this project is quite simple in analysis, there are a few eye-opening findings that inform us about the impact of the pandemic on the local community that goes beyond how humans socialize. The data set was procured from Seattle's Open Data Program. 

Please refer to the PDF file in this repo to read the full report.
